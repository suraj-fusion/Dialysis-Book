# Dialysis Book 📘

A modern mobile app built using **React Native** and **Expo**, designed to help users track and manage their dialysis sessions efficiently. 

---

## 💡 Motivation

Dialysis Book was born from a personal need — my father is undergoing regular dialysis treatments, and we found it difficult to keep track of session details like timings, weight changes, and blood pressure. Traditional paper records or scattered notes were unreliable and inconvenient.

This app is my way of solving that problem with technology. It’s built to help families like mine — and anyone managing dialysis — stay organized, informed, and in control of their treatment history.

- 📊 View session history in a clean interface
- 📝 Add/edit/delete sessions
- ☁️ Offline-first experience
- 🎨 Beautiful and responsive UI
